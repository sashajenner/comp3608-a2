The main findings of our results include that CFS is hugely beneficial for all non-trivial classifiers but especially for tree-based classifiers. CFS also highlighted the attributes with the best predictive power for the onset of diabetes, including age which is quite interesting. In fact, younger Pima Indian females were less likely to develop diabetes given a medium glucose level according to the pruned decision tree in Figure \ref{fig:dt_prune} than older females.

Furthermore, nominal classifiers performed significantly better than numeric classifiers on this dataset with a $\sim$4\% higher mean accuracy. This suggests that perhaps relationships in the dataset between different attributes and the onset of diabetes is highly discrete and non-continuous.

Finally, it was also found that

Future work to be done includes using deep learning methods to try and develop a more accurate classifier on this dataset. As well as, investigating the same 14 classifiers but on a completely new and unrelated dataset in order to draw more well-rounded conclusions.
