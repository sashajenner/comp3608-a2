\subsection{Aim}

The aim of this study is to investigate methods for predicting the future onset of diabetes mellitus (or simply diabetes), with relevance to females over 21 and of Pima Indian heritage.

\subsection{Relevance}
This study is important because the classifiers created have the potential to forewarn individuals of their risk to diabetes, and to be used as an easy clinical tool for early prevention. This is particularly important because, if left untreated, diabetes can lead to many serious long-term health implications such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetic ketoacidosis and even death \cite{diabetes}.
