Insulin secretion/insulin resistance index was calculated as the product of Matsuda index and ΔI0{\textendash}30/ΔG0{\textendash}30 or ΔI0{\textendash}120/ΔG0{\textendash}120. The discriminatory power of various prediction models for development of type 2 diabetes was tested with the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS{\textemdash}Insulin secretion/insulin resistance index (0- to 30- and 0- to 120-min time periods) had the greatest areas under the ROC curve (0.85 and 0.86, respectively), which were significantly greater than the 2-h plasma glucose concentration during the OGTT or the San Antonio Diabetes Prediction Model (SADPM) (P \&lt; 0.001 and P \&lt; 0.0001, respectively). A model based on the combination of the SADPM and a modified version of the insulin secretion/insulin resistance index or 1-h plasma glucose concentration had equal power to predict the risk for future type 2 diabetes compared with the insulin secretion/insulin resistance index. CONCLUSIONS{\textemdash}The insulin secretion/insulin resistance index is useful as a predictor of future development of type 2 diabetes. A model based on the combination of the SADPM and either a modified version of the insulin secretion/insulin resistance index or 1-h plasma glucose concentration can equally predict future type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Diabetes is a common, chronic disease. Prediction of diabetes at an early stage can lead to improved treatment. Data mining techniques are widely used for prediction of disease at an early stage. In this research paper, diabetes is predicted using significant attributes, and the relationship of the differing attributes is also characterized. Various tools are used to determine significant attribute selection, and for clustering, prediction, and association rule mining for diabetes. Significant attributes selection was done via the principal component analysis method. Our findings indicate a strong association of diabetes with body mass index (BMI) and with glucose level, which was extracted via the Apriori method. Artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF) and K-means clustering techniques were implemented for the prediction of diabetes. The ANN technique provided a best accuracy of 75.7%, and may be useful to assist medical professionals with treatment decisions.}

Present study tries to find out correlation between them.Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted in private medical college among 2nd year MBBS students. Total 24 students were sampled by purposive sampling method. After obtaining permission from Institutional Ethics committee and written informed consent from participants, study information was gathered using semi structured proforma. Anthropometric measurements were taken using standard techniques and equipments. Data was analysed using Microsoft Excel and Prism version 5.0 and appropriate tests were used considering normality of data.Results: Out of 24 study participants 14 were males and 10 were females. Mean weight was 59.29±12.59 kg, mean height was 164.77±10.28 cm, mean BMI was 21.68±3.18 kg/m2. Mean biceps skin fold thickness was 7.20±2.68 mm and mean triceps skin fold thickness was 10.75±3.33mm. Of all the participants 4 (16.67%) were having underweight BMI, 15 (62.50%) were having normal BMI, 5 (20.83%) were pre-obese. BMI correlated significantly with triceps skin fold thickness Spearman’s r=0.53, p=0.006 as compared to biceps skin fold thickness Spearman’s r=0.36, p=0.07 in complete sample. Among males BMI correlated significantly with triceps skin fold thickness Spearman’s r=0.64, p=0.01 as compared to biceps skin fold thickness.Conclusions: BMI correlates significantly with triceps skin fold thickness as compared to biceps skin fold thickness in general. Significant correlation between BMI and triceps skin fold thickness was found with males as compared to females.},

abstract = {Background
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by insufficient insulin production or ineffective pancreatic secretions. In Ghana, the prevalence of DM was estimated to be 6.3% amongst men and women older than 30 years living in the Greater Accra region. The disease can be determined by various means including the use of the multistix that assesses the presence of glucose in urine.
Materials and methods
In this study, 100 subjects were sampled made up of 65% males and 35% females whose urine samples were verified using multistix.
Results
Most (63%) of the subjects diagnosed with the disease fell within the age ranges of 60–69 years and 70–79 years, thus establishing the fact that the incidence of the disease increases with increasing age and increasing body mass index (BMI) over above 25kg/m2. Some (44%) had a family history of diabetes. Other factors such as the socioeconomic status (SES) categories, physical activity levels and eating habits of the respondents played different roles in the occurrence of the disease.
Conclusion
The sex of the individual, however, did not have a major impact on the occurrence of the disease. This study confirmed that overweight body (BMI≥25kg/m2) especially of older ages above 50 years of have very strong link with the prevalence of diabetes mellitus.}
