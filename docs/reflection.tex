\section{Reflection}

% (meaningful and relevant personal reflection)
% Write one or two paragraphs describing the most important thing that you have learned throughout this assignment.

One important thing that we have learned throughout this assignment is the power of feature selection, namely CFS, in increasing the performance of classifiers whether numeric or nominal. We also learned a lot about Latex formatting and working in a group using GitHub. We also discovered how interesting ensemble methods can be such as boosting and bagging.

However, overall we believe the best part about this assignment was learning how to use the powerful tool Weka. At first we were put off as the program seemed old and had a confusing user interface, but after getting the hang of it we began to realise its true potential as a tool for quickly processing data and then training powerful ML models.
