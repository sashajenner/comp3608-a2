The most important thing that I have learned throughout this assignment is the power of feature selection, namely CFS, in increasing the performance of classifiers whether numeric or nominal. I also learned a lot about Latex formatting and working in a group using GitHub. I also discovered how interesting ensemble methods can be such as boosting and bagging.
